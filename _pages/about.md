This module deals with computer processing of human languages, including the use of neural networks and deep learning in natural language processing. The topics covered include: regular expressions, words and edit distance, n-grams, part-of-speech tagging, feed-forward neural networks, neural network training, word embedding, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, sequence-to-sequence models with attention, transformers, context-free grammars, syntactic parsing, semantics, and discourse.

We will be using the [LumiNUS](https://luminus.nus.edu.sg/modules/7ed05d58-129e-4b4e-a9e3-22802fc6f8e8) ðŸ”’ Learning Management System for the administration of this course.  We will also be using a Slack group for both announcements and class discussion.  Please join it using your LumiNUS registered email address: [cs4248-2120.slack.com](https://cs4248-2120.slack.com/).

N.B. We will be teaching and using the Python programming language throughout this class and Jupyter Notebook via Google Colab. We will using Python 3.x, and largely the SciKitLearn and PyTorch libraries.

## Tutorial Sessions

There will be tutorials for this class starting in Week 03. As the class is flipped, these sessions will be the primary means by which we touch base with you and get to know you personally.  Tutorials will be held roughly bi-weekly (once every two weeks).  Please do attend these session (physically or via Zoom), as they will not be webcasted (although tutorial solutions will be distributed, you should come to the sessions to get the complete picture, and to be a part of the class).

These tutorial session timings still subject to change. Please see NUSMods for the most up-to-date details. As an enrolled student, you are entitled to one tutorial placement, and need to attend that slot even if not optimal for you.

Tutorial Sessions (tentative):

1. T01. Tuesdays, 13:00-14:00 (Seminar Room 2; SR2, COM1 02-04)
2. T02. Tuesdays, 14:00-15:00 (Seminar Room 2; SR2, COM1 02-04)
3. T03. Wednesdays, 13:00-14:00 (Seminar Room 2; SR2, COM1 02-04)
4. T04. Wednesdays, 14:00-15:00 (Seminar Room 2; SR2, COM1 02-04)
4. T05. Wednesdays, 15:00-16:00 (Seminar Room 2; SR2, COM1 02-04)

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. Will the module be webcasted (recorded or broadcasted live)?
   Yes, barring technical difficulties, we plan to record the course lectures and make them available on LumiNUS.  That is, we will make our best effort to do this, but do not guarantee quality of service for webcasted or remote learning.  We will attempt to make the lectures available on simulcast on Zoom, links to be available to course students only (you will need to be authenticated to your NUS-linked Zoom account to connect to the lectures).

   Recorded lectures will be put into the `Web Lectures` folder on the LumiNUS platform.

2. I'd like to take this module but couldn't secure it during ModReg because the quota is full.  Will it be possible to make an exception?

   See below answers to similar questions.  Generally the answer is no, but we welcome students to audit the class, or take the class in subsequent semesters (CS4248 is offered in both Sem 1 and 2 now).  We know the demand is high (we heard 160 students for 100 slots), but we need to keep the student cap at a reasonable number this semester.  

   If you'd like to audit, please send a mail to cs4248@comp.nus.edu.sg or a DM to @Min with your name and NUS LumiNUS-registered email address.

3. The course is stated as having a physical class at Lecture Theatre 19.  Is that correct?

   Yes.  Lecture will be on Fridays physically at LT19.  LT19 has a physical safe distancing limit of 50 students, so the first 50 students are welcomed at the LT and we will implement the NUS Classroom Attendance System to ensure that those who wish to attend can.  If coming to the class, please make it to the venue by 8:55 so that class can start on-time.

   A fixed Zoom session e-learning option will be given out students to attend class if not attending physically (see first QA item)

4. I'm taking ATAP this semester.  I need an exception to get admitted to this class.  Can you grant me this exception?

   Sorry, no.  This is a unilateral policy.  CS4248 is in high demand and generally oversubscribed.  We reserve and exercise the right to make this course only available to full-time NUS students (locally matriculated and exchange students).  We welcome you to take the course when you return to NUS full-time.

5. I do not fulfill the exact prerequisite requirements for this module.  Can you grant me this exception?

   Module coordinators do not approve prerequisite waivers in our School.  You need to approach our School's curriculum coordinator for permission.  Generally, the answer is no, except in extenuating circumstances.  E-mail `cs-curriculum@comp.nus.edu.sg` and apply for the waiver on ModRec.

6. I need this course in order to graduate this coming semester.  Can you grant me this exception?

   Please ask your academic advisor to explain the situation to me.  We will see what we can do and perhaps help your academic advisor help plan future students' plans accordingly.
